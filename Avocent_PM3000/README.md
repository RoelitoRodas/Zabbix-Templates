Template for an Avocent PM3000 PDU.

Notes:

* Currently only temperature sensor is supported
* If you chain PDU's you need to clone the Chained PDU template and update the PDUID macro to 1,2,3 etc..
* Link both the PDU and chained PDU templates to your device.
* You need the UCD-SNMP template for cpu/mem/etc
